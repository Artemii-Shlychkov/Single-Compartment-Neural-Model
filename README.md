# Single-Compartment-Neural-Model

## Overview
The notebook is focused on a Single Compartment Model, specifically illustrating how to model the response of a point neuron with a passive membrane to an input current using Python. It provides a comprehensive overview of simulating a neuron's electrical behavior in response to stimulation, a foundational concept in computational neuroscience. It aims to model the membrane potential response V(t) over time to an input current I_e(t) using an electrical circuit model approximation and numerical methods, namely backward Euler's method

## Structure

1. Establishing model parameters, such as physical and electrical properties of the model neuron,essential for calculating the neuron's response to electrical input, considering the neuron as a simplified electrical circuit.
2. Defining the electrical current function
3. The Differential Equation (DEQ) and solving it numerically, using backward Euler's method
4. Exploring the influence of parameters on the output
5. Analyzing the results

## Summary
The notebook is centered around setting up and solving a mathematical model for the response of a neuron's membrane potential to an input current. It walks through setting up model parameters, converting these parameters into a usable form, and then numerically approximating the membrane potential over time using Euler methods. The notebook is a demonstartion of computational approaches to neuroscience or related fields.
